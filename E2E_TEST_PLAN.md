## 13. curl Test Scripts

These commands can be run from any machine with `curl` installed. Replace `$STARTED_AT` with a timestamp ≥ 2 seconds in the past.

### Health check
```bash
curl -s https://careers.darumatic.com/api/health
# Expected: {"ok":true}
```

### Careers listing API
```bash
curl -s https://careers.darumatic.com/api/careers/jobs | python3 -m json.tool | head -40
# Expected: {"jobs":[...]} with at least one entry
```

### Job detail API (check applicationQuestions present)
```bash
curl -s https://careers.darumatic.com/api/careers/jobs/1 | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A 20 "applicationQuestions"
# Expected: array of question objects with id, label, required
```

### Submit application with answers
```bash
# Create a minimal PDF
echo '%PDF-1.4 1 0 obj<</Type/Catalog>>endobj' > /tmp/test.pdf

STARTED_AT=$(( ($(date +%s) - 300) * 1000 ))
ANSWERS='[
  {"questionId":"<question-id-from-api>","answer":"Australian citizen, full working rights"},
  {"questionId":"<question-id-2>","answer":"Available in 2 weeks"},
  {"questionId":"<question-id-3>","answer":"$110,000 base + super"}
]'

curl -s -X POST https://careers.darumatic.com/api/careers/jobs/1/apply \
  -F "firstName=Jane" \
  -F "lastName=Smith" \
  -F "email=jane.smith.$(date +%s)@example.com" \
  -F "mobile=0412345678" \
  -F "zipCode=2000" \
  -F "linkedinUrl=" \
  -F "faxNumber=" \
  -F "startedAtMs=$STARTED_AT" \
  -F "applicationAnswers=$ANSWERS" \
  -F "resumeFile=@/tmp/test.pdf;type=application/pdf"
# Expected: {"ok":true,"message":"Application submitted successfully.","submissionId":N,...}
```

### Verify answers stored in DB
```bash
# SSH to server then run:
ssh root@139.180.182.102 \
  'mysql hiregnome -e "SELECT id, customFields FROM Submission ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;"'
# Expected: customFields contains {"applicationAnswers":[{"question":"...","answer":"..."},...]}'
```

### Honeypot test (should return 200 but create no DB row)
```bash
MAX_SUB=$(ssh root@139.180.182.102 'mysql hiregnome -N -e "SELECT MAX(id) FROM Submission;"')

curl -s -X POST https://careers.darumatic.com/api/careers/jobs/1/apply \
  -F "firstName=Bot" -F "lastName=Test" \
  -F "email=bot@example.com" \
  -F "mobile=0400000000" -F "zipCode=2000" \
  -F "startedAtMs=$(( ($(date +%s) - 300) * 1000 ))" \
  -F "faxNumber=1234567890" \
  -F "resumeFile=@/tmp/test.pdf;type=application/pdf"
# Response: {"ok":true,"message":"Application submitted successfully."}

NEW_MAX=$(ssh root@139.180.182.102 'mysql hiregnome -N -e "SELECT MAX(id) FROM Submission;"')
[ "$MAX_SUB" = "$NEW_MAX" ] && echo "PASS: no new submission" || echo "FAIL: submission created"
```

*This test plan covers the full user journey from public careers site through ATS internal workflows. Run TC-PUB and TC-SUB groups after every deployment that touches the career site or submission handling. Run TC-AUTH and TC-SEC groups after any authentication or security-related changes.*
